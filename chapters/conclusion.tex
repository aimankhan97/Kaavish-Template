We have a working prototype of a virtual self defence trainer that gives realistic haptic feedback on the right arm along with user friendly feedback in natural language. We have been successful in amalgamating the positive aspects existing in literature including, but not limited to, natural language feedback, haptic calibration, force feedback and impact feedback using EMS and a user friendly user interface. 
Further work includes, extending the haptic feedback to both arms followed by fully body haptic suit, teaching more sets of moves and the use of EMG to replace manual calibration protocol. Furthermore, the scoring can be improved to incorporate more variables. The practices can be shifted to a virtual reality or augmented reality setting where the user interacts with the avatar that teaches directly, basically forming a dojo virtually. This technology can easily be applied to other training as well. Another important avenue to look at is the shifting of the computation, including and not limited to the pose evaluation to a cloud server so that the program can be used by users having weaker machines. The possibilities to go further with this are limitless.

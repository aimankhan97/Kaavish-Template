We have a working prototype of a virtual self defence training software offers video tutorials to users for learning punch-block sequence. It also provides practice sessions with a 3D virtual avatar, the sessions are integrated with pose evaluation module which is responsible for evaluating user's pose and provide feedback for improvement. In addition to detailed feedback, these sessions also provide realistic haptic feedback on the right during interaction with the avatar. We have been successful in amalgamating the positive aspects existing in literature including, but not limited to, natural language feedback, scoring user's performance, haptic calibration, force feedback and impact feedback using EMS and a user friendly user interface. 


Further work includes, extending the haptic feedback to both arms followed by fully body haptic suit and the use of EMG to replace manual calibration protocol. Other useful self-defense skills are yet to be incorporated into the system, so that it offers a complete set of basic self-defense skills to serve the purpose intended. The scoring mechanism can be further improved to incorporate more features. The practice sessions can be shifted to a virtual reality or augmented reality setting where the user interacts with the avatar that teaches directly, basically forming a dojo virtually. This technology can easily be applied to other training as well. Another important avenue to look at is the shifting of the computation, including and not limited to the pose evaluation to a cloud server so that the program can also be used by users having devices with lesser computation power as required. We can also get a self-defense trainer on board to rank and judge the feedback and scoring suggested by the system so we have a ground truth to work with and compare our system against, which could very likely improve the pose evaluation module. With huge number of dataset, we can also incorporate deep learning models that learn the features directly without identifying, because identifying the features takes a lot of work and study into the performance of a practicular skill. The possibilities to go further with this are limitless.
